# SatGen

A semi-analytical satellite galaxy and dark matter halo generator,
introduced in Jiang et al. (2020), extended in Green et al. (2021a) and
Green et al. (2021b). Adapted for [Monzon et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...976..197M/abstract).

This forked repository includes the base files that make up the SatGen SAM 
and new code that mainly handles its output. Almost all new additions that are
relevant for the 2024 paper are in /MCMC. Associated figures were all made using notebooks
