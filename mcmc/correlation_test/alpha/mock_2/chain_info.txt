This run was measured against data with truth values of [10.5, 1.5, 0.2, 0, 0, 0]

It was initialized at [10.5, 1.5, 0.2, 0, 0, 0]

The chain has 100 walkers and 3000 steps

It was initialized with a_stretch = 2.0

The run took 12.0 hours

The mean acceptance fraction turned out to be 0.54643

The auto correlation time (Nsteps) was[        nan 40.23296397 40.69135648         nan         nan         nan]

The final step in the chain gives the following constraints on theta
