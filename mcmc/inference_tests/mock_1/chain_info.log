INFO:root:This run was measured against data with truth values of [10.5  2.   0.   0.   0.2  0. ]
INFO:root:It was initialized at [10.5  2.   0.   0.   0.2  0. ] with a gaussian width of 0.01
INFO:root:The chain has 15 walkers and 30 steps
INFO:root:It was initialized with a_stretch = 2.0
WARNING:emcee.autocorr:The chain is shorter than 50 times the integrated autocorrelation time for 2 parameter(s). Use this estimate with caution and run a longer chain!
