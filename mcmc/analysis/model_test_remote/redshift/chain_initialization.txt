This run was measured against data with truth values of [2, 0.2, 10.5, 0, 0, 0]

It was initialized at [1.8, 0.3, 10.5, -0.1, -0.01, 0]

The chain has 300 walkers and 1000 steps

It was initialized with a_stretch = 2.3

The mean acceptance fraction is 0.14081666666666667

The final step in the chain gives the following constraints
