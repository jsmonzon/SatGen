This run was measured against data with truth values of [2, 0.2, 10.5, 0, 0]

It was initialized at [1.9, 0.2, 10.6, -0.1, -0.01]

The chain has 50 walkers and 50 steps

It was initialized with a_stretch = 2.3

The mean acceptance fraction is 0.35159999999999997

The final step in the chain gives the following constraints
