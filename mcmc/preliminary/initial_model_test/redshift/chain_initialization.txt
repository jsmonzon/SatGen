This run was measured against data with truth values of [1.8, -0.1, 10, 0.2, -0.1, 0.02]

It was initialized at [2, 0, 10, 0.25, -0.01, 0]

The chain has 300 walkers and 1000 steps

It was initialized with a_stretch = 2.3

The mean acceptance fraction is 0.19032666666666667

The final step in the chain gives the following constraints
